What do you like to do?
I like dancing
But I don’t like dancing with a bear
I like swimming
But I don’t like swimming in the air
I like drawing
But I don’t like drawing with a spoon
I like cooking
But I don’t like cooking on the moon
I like riding a bike
But I don’t like riding a shark
I like petting a soft furry dog
But I don’t like petting an aardvark
